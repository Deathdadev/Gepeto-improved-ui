## Prerequisites

Before you begin, ensure you have the following installed:
*   [Node.js](https://nodejs.org/) (LTS version recommended)
*   [npm](https://www.npmjs.com/) (comes with Node.js) or [yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/)

## Setup and Installation

1.  **Clone the repository** (if you haven't already):
    ```bash
    git clone https://github.com/Deathdadev/Gepeto-improved-ui
    cd Gepeto-improved-ui
    ```

2.  **Install dependencies**:
    Run:
    ```bash
    npm install
    ```
    or if you prefer yarn:
    ```bash
    yarn install
    ```

## Running the Project

To start the development server, run the following command in the project root directory:
```bash
npm run dev
```
or
```bash
yarn dev
```
This will start the Vite development server, typically available at `http://localhost:5173` (the exact port might vary, check the terminal output).

## Building for Production

To create a production build of the application, run:
```bash
npm run build
```
or
```bash
yarn build
```
This command will generate optimized static assets in the `dist` directory.
